//! Direct ports of the standard library's [`BTreeMap`][std::collections::BTreeMap],
//! [`BTreeSet`][std::collections::BTreeSet] and [`BinaryHeap`][std::collections::BinaryHeap]
//! collections, but which sort according to a specified [`TotalOrder`] rather than relying upon
//! the [`Ord`] trait.
//!
//! This is primarily useful when the [`TotalOrder`] depends upon runtime state, and therefore
//! cannot be provided as an [`Ord`] implementation for any type.
//!
//! # Lookup keys
//! In the standard library's collections, certain lookups can be performed using a key of type
//! `&Q` where the collection's storage key type `K` implements [`Borrow<Q>`]; for example, one
//! can use `&str` keys to perform lookups into collections that store `String` keys.  This is
//! possible because the [`Borrow`] trait stipulates that borrowed values must preserve [`Ord`]
//! order.
//!
//! However, copse's collections do not use the [`Ord`] trait; instead, lookups can only ever
//! be performed using the [`TotalOrder`] supplied upon collection creation.  This total order
//! can only compare values of its [`OrderedType`][TotalOrder::OrderedType] associated type,
//! and hence keys used for lookups must implement [`LookupKey<O>`] in order that the
//! conversion can be performed.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```rust
//! # use core::cmp::Ordering;
//! # use copse::{TotalOrder, LookupKey, BTreeSet};
//! #
//! // define a total order
//! struct OrderByNthByte {
//!     n: usize, // runtime state
//! }
//!
//! impl TotalOrder for OrderByNthByte {
//!     type OrderedType = [u8];
//!     fn cmp(&self, this: &[u8], that: &[u8]) -> Ordering {
//!         match (this.get(self.n), that.get(self.n)) {
//!             (Some(lhs), Some(rhs)) => lhs.cmp(rhs),
//!             (Some(_), None) => Ordering::Greater,
//!             (None, Some(_)) => Ordering::Less,
//!             (None, None) => Ordering::Equal,
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // define lookup key types for collections sorted by our total order
//! impl LookupKey<OrderByNthByte> for [u8] {
//!     fn key(&self) -> &[u8] { self }
//! }
//! impl LookupKey<OrderByNthByte> for str {
//!     fn key(&self) -> &[u8] { self.as_bytes() }
//! }
//! impl LookupKey<OrderByNthByte> for String {
//!     fn key(&self) -> &[u8] { LookupKey::<OrderByNthByte>::key(self.as_str()) }
//! }
//!
//! // create a collection using our total order
//! let mut set = BTreeSet::new(OrderByNthByte { n: 9 });
//! assert!(set.insert("abcdefghijklm".to_string()));
//! assert!(!set.insert("xxxxxxxxxjxx".to_string()));
//! assert!(set.contains("jjjjjjjjjj"));
//! ```
//!
//! # Collection type parameters
//! In addition to the type parameters familiar from the standard library collections, copse's
//! collections are additionally parameterised by the type of the [`TotalOrder`].  If the
//! total order is not explicitly named, it defaults to the [`OrdTotalOrder`] for the storage
//! key's [`DefaultComparisonKey`][OrdStoredKey::DefaultComparisonKey], which yields behaviour
//! analagous to the standard library collections (i.e. sorted by the `Ord` trait).  If you
//! find yourself using these items, then you should probably ditch copse for the standard
//! library instead.
//!
//! # Crate feature flags
//! This crate defines a number of feature flags, none of which are enabled by default:
//!
//! * the `std` feature provides [`OrdStoredKey`] implementations for some libstd types
//!   that are not available in libcore + liballoc, namely [`OsString`] and [`PathBuf`];
//!
//! * the `unstable` feature enables all unstable features of the stdlib's BTree and
//!   BinaryHeap collection implementations that are purely contained therein, and which
//!   therefore do not require a nightly toolchain.
//!
//! * the `btreemap_alloc` feature enables the like-named unstable compiler feature, thus
//!   exposing the collections' `new_in` methods; however this feature depends upon the
//!   `allocator_api` unstable compiler feature that is only available with a nightly
//!   toolchain.
//!
//! * the `nightly` feature enables all other crate features, each of which enables the
//!   like-named unstable compiler feature that is used by the standard library's collection
//!   implementations (and which therefore require a nightly compiler)â€”most such behaviour
//!   is polyfilled when the features are disabled, so they should rarely be required, but
//!   they are nevertheless included to ease tracking of the stdlib implementations.
